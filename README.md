Put dvrtodavincibridge.py in same folder dvrscan outputs log files to (if it outputs to desktop, place it on the desktop), once you run the script, the terminal will ask for the name of the file with extension so if the output of dvrscan is "log.txt", you will type "log.txt" without quotes. The terminal will show each timestamp then give a "completed" message with the folder/path that event.edl file will be saved to.
